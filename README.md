# TetrisGL

A simplified version of [The Tetris Master](https://github.com/amaiorano/TheTetrisMaster) that renders using immediate mode OpenGL.


# History

Note that I wrote the original code in 1999, and later made this simplified version in 2003. Although it is an old project, I decided to open source it as the code is easy to understand, and figured it could be a useful tool for learning how to make a simple game in C++.


## Building the Game

Use Visual Studio 2013 to open TetrisGL.sln and build.
